# Adam S. Ford - Smart TV Commercial Mute
UPDATE: The more I research this, the more it looks like I will build a piece of hardware, such as a Raspberry Pi, program it, and physically attach it to her television. Research is on-going...

My mother manually mutes every commercial on television. I wanted to find a way to automate this for her. This is an on-going project, but here is the conversation started with ChatGTP to explore the subject...

***Adam-***
- Are there third-party apps available to use on my modern internet-connected television? For example, is there a third-party app that will compress the volume to normalize the changes in volume between television shows and commercials?

***ChatGTP-***
- Most modern smart TVs already include built‑in volume normalization features—often labeled “Auto Volume,” “Volume Leveling,” or “Stable Volume”—that help smooth out the differences between regular programming and louder commercials. For example, many Samsung and Philips TVs offer these settings directly in their menus, so you can adjust them without needing an extra app

As for third‑party apps, options are very limited. Due to the closed nature of most TV operating systems, manufacturers tend to integrate these features directly rather than allow external apps to modify the audio output. While a few Android‑based TV platforms might offer audio processing or equalizer apps on the Google Play Store, these are generally not designed specifically for compressing volume changes between content and ads, and they may require extra tweaking or even sideloading.

In short, if your TV doesn’t have satisfactory volume normalization built‑in, you might consider using an external audio device (like a receiver with dynamic range compression) rather than searching for a third‑party app on the TV itself.

***Adam-***
- I have an end-goal of using an app on my Samsung smart TV that will mute commercials. How would I create such an app? Please ask me questions for clarity.

***ChatGTP-***
- To help me understand your project better and give you the most relevant guidance, I have a few clarifying questions:

1. **Platform & Experience:**  
   - Are you already familiar with developing apps for Samsung Smart TVs (which typically run on Tizen OS)?  
   - Do you have any previous experience with Tizen Studio or similar development environments?

2. **Detection Mechanism:**  
   - How do you envision detecting commercials? Are you considering real‑time audio analysis (e.g., detecting changes in volume or audio fingerprinting), using metadata cues, or another approach?  
   - Do you plan on processing the audio stream locally on the TV, or would you integrate an external service or device to help with detection?

3. **Functionality & Integration:**  
   - Do you want the app to automatically mute the TV when it detects a commercial, or would you prefer a manual override (e.g., a remote control feature that lets you quickly mute/unmute)?  
   - Are you aiming for the app to work alongside the TV’s native features, or would it replace any existing functionality?

4. **Technical Constraints:**  
   - Have you looked into the Samsung Smart TV SDK documentation regarding access to audio streams and system-level volume control?  
   - Do you know if there are any restrictions or permissions needed for an app to modify audio output on your specific Samsung model?

Understanding these details will help narrow down the technical requirements and possible approaches. Could you share more about your current vision and any constraints you’re aware of?

***Adam-***
- I am not familiar with Tizen OS. I want to process the audio stream locally on the TV. I want the app to automatically mute the TV when it detects a commercial. I am aware of restrictions against creating such an app to sell for profit, but I am not restricted to use such an app on the TV I own in my own home. 

***ChatGTP-***
- Thanks for sharing those details. Based on what you've said, here are some questions to help refine the approach:

1. **Development Environment:**  
   - Are you open to learning native Tizen app development (using C/C++ with Tizen Native APIs) as opposed to web-based development with JavaScript/HTML5? Native apps might offer more low‑level access that could be necessary for processing audio.

2. **Audio Access & Processing:**  
   - Have you reviewed the Tizen developer documentation to see if there’s any supported way to capture or access the live audio output from the TV for processing? (Many Smart TV platforms restrict this for security and performance reasons.)
   - Do you have a specific digital signal processing (DSP) approach in mind—for example, using a volume threshold or more complex audio fingerprinting—to distinguish commercials from regular programming?

3. **Performance Considerations:**  
   - The processing will need to run in real‑time on the TV’s hardware. Have you considered if the TV’s processor can handle the DSP workload required without impacting performance?

4. **Control of TV Audio:**  
   - Have you looked into the available APIs for controlling system volume or muting the TV? Some manufacturers expose these controls, but they might be limited.

5. **Fallback Options:**  
   - Would you consider a hybrid solution where an external microcontroller or smartphone listens to the TV’s audio (via a microphone or direct connection) and sends mute commands to the TV over the network?  
   - If processing on the TV itself proves too restricted, is integrating an external device acceptable?

These questions will help pinpoint the technical path forward. Let me know your thoughts on these points, and we can dive deeper into specific documentation or strategies!

***Adam-***
- I do not want to use a volume threshold to distinguish commercials from regular programming. I need to use a different method to distinguish commercials from regular programming. Yes, I would consider a hybrid solution where an external microcontroller or smartphone listens to the TV’s audio (via a microphone or direct connection) and sends mute commands to the TV over the network. If processing on the TV itself proves too restricted, yes, integrating an external device is acceptable.

***ChatGTP-***
- Great – that gives us a good starting point. Here are some more questions to help narrow down the approach:

1. **Detection Method:**  
   - Since you don’t want to rely on a simple volume threshold, are you considering using a machine learning–based audio classifier (e.g., trained on features extracted from commercials vs. programming)?  
   - Have you thought about other distinguishing factors, such as specific audio fingerprints or even visual cues (if you’re open to combining audio and video analysis)?

2. **Hardware & Processing:**  
   - Which external device do you envision using for processing? A smartphone, a Raspberry Pi, or another microcontroller with sufficient processing power?  
   - Do you have any preferences regarding the programming environment or frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Lite on a Raspberry Pi, or a dedicated Android app on your smartphone)?

3. **Integration with the TV:**  
   - How do you plan on sending mute commands to your TV over the network? Are you aware of any specific APIs or protocols (such as Samsung’s SmartThings or Tizen remote control APIs) for your model?  
   - Do you require the solution to automatically unmute when programming resumes, and if so, what’s your desired latency for these transitions?

4. **Training Data & Model Development:**  
   - Do you have access to a dataset of commercials versus regular programming for training purposes, or would you need to build one yourself?  
   - Are you open to starting with a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it, or do you plan to develop a custom model from scratch?

Answering these questions will help us define the technical requirements and the best path forward for your project. Let me know your thoughts!

***Adam-***
- Yes, I am considering using a machine learning–based audio classifier (e.g., trained on features extracted from commercials vs. programming). I would prefer the use of a smartphone, both iOS and Android platforms. I would also consider the use of a Raspberry Pi or another microcontroller with sufficient processing power. I would like to mute the television in the simplest manner possible. I require the solution to automatically unmute when programming resumes. I desire the least amount of latency for these transitions possible, possibly less than one second. I would like access to a dataset of commercials versus regular programming for training purposes and the dataset must be updated every week. I would prefer to start with a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it.

***ChatGTP-***
- Based on your answers, here’s an outline of one potential approach to creating an app that automatically mutes your TV during commercials:

---

### 1. Overall Architecture

- **Input Capture:**  
  – **Smartphone Option:** Develop an iOS/Android app that uses the device’s microphone (or an auxiliary audio input) to continuously capture the audio output from your TV.  
  – **External Device Option:** Use a Raspberry Pi (or another microcontroller with sufficient processing power) connected via a direct audio line or an external microphone.

- **Real-Time Audio Processing:**  
  – Use a machine learning–based audio classifier that distinguishes commercials from regular programming.  
  – Instead of a simple volume threshold, your classifier would analyze features (e.g., spectral features, temporal patterns) to detect the “commercial signature.”  
  – For low latency (ideally under one second), you’ll need to optimize your model for real-time inference—consider using frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite (for Android and Raspberry Pi) and Core ML (for iOS).

- **Model Development:**  
  – **Pre-Trained Model:** Start with an existing audio classification model (such as one available on TensorFlow Hub) and fine-tune it on a dataset that distinguishes commercials from regular programming.  
  – **Dataset Updates:** To keep the classifier accurate, set up a pipeline (perhaps using web scraping or integration with broadcast APIs) to collect and update a dataset on a weekly basis. Public platforms like Kaggle might have relevant datasets, though you may need to augment them with your own data.

- **Control Integration:**  
  – Once the classifier detects a commercial, the app should immediately send a “mute” command to the TV.  
  – For Samsung TVs, you may be able to use available network APIs (e.g., through Tizen remote control APIs or SmartThings) to control volume.  
  – Ensure that the system automatically unmutes as soon as the classifier determines that regular programming has resumed.

### 2. Key Technical Considerations

- **Real-Time Inference & Latency:**  
  – The classifier must process audio segments quickly. Investigate the trade-offs between model complexity and inference speed to meet your sub‑one‑second transition requirement.
  
- **Model Accuracy & Robustness:**  
  – Fine-tune using a pre-trained model and continuously update your training dataset to account for new commercial styles and variations in programming.
  
- **Cross‑Platform Development:**  
  – For smartphone apps, you’ll likely develop separate versions for iOS (using Swift/Objective‑C with Core ML) and Android (using Java/Kotlin with TensorFlow Lite).  
  – Consider whether you can share code between platforms (for example, by using a cross‑platform framework) while still meeting your performance goals.
  
- **TV Integration:**  
  – Research the APIs available for your specific Samsung model to see how you can send mute/unmute commands over your local network. Documentation on Tizen or SmartThings might be a good starting point.
  
- **Fallback & Safety:**  
  – Design the system so that it fails safely (e.g., if the classifier is unsure, it might avoid toggling mute to prevent constant disruptions).

### 3. Next Steps & Resources

- **Development Environment:**  
  – Familiarize yourself with the Samsung Smart TV developer documentation if you eventually decide to integrate directly with the TV.  
  – Explore TensorFlow Lite and Core ML documentation for deploying machine learning models on mobile devices.

- **Data & Model Resources:**  
  – Look into audio datasets on platforms like Kaggle as a starting point. You may need to build a custom dataset, so consider setting up an automated pipeline (using Python scripts, for example) to gather commercials and programming segments from available sources.
  
- **Prototyping:**  
  – Start by creating a simple prototype on a smartphone that captures audio and performs real-time inference using a pre-trained model. Test latency and adjust as needed.
  – Experiment with sending network commands to your TV from your smartphone or Raspberry Pi once your classifier is reliably detecting commercials.

This hybrid approach—using a smartphone or external microcontroller for real‑time audio classification and then sending remote commands to your TV—should help you achieve your goal of automatically muting commercials with minimal latency.

Would you like more details on any specific part of this approach (e.g., setting up the audio processing pipeline, model fine‑tuning, or TV integration APIs)? Let me know what you'd like to dive deeper into!
